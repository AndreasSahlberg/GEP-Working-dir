# GEP-Working-dir

This is a folder that we internally use at KTH dESA in order to induce code changes without having to commit them to our 
official Github repository.

Note that code is updated regularly by Andreas, Babak and Alex. We upload only the precalibration csv file as up-to-date. The calibrated file and scenario result files are stored localy due to github's size limitation for uploading. You may request the person that induced the last commit about an update prior using. 

Best,
KTH OnSSET team
